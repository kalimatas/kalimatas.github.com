		<h1>Tie-breaking Rounding</h1>
	
	<time class="post-date">May 14, 2017</time>
	<section id="article-content">
		<p>So I was reading an article about <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html#bankers-rounding">differences between Python 2 and Python 3</a>, and there was a statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python 3 adopted the now standard way of rounding decimals when it results in a tie (.5) at the last significant digits. Now, in Python 3, decimals are rounded to the nearest even number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, I was like “WTF?!”. At school I was taught a simple rule: if x is exactly half-way between two integers - round to the largest absolute value, i.e. 13.5 becomes 14, and -13.5 becomes -14. No magic with even/odd numbers. It wasn’t even discussed, that there are might be different ways of rounding.</p>

<p>But, as it often happens with school program, they didn’t tell us all the truth.</p>

<p>There are actually six more or less normal ways and two not so normal, thus leaving us with eight (eight, Carl!) rules of rounding.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>These are the <em>normal</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Tie-breaking">rules</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round half down (or towards negative infinity): 13.5 rounds to 13, -13.5 rounds to -14.</li>
  <li>Round half up (or towards positive infinity): 13.5 rounds to 14, -13.5 rounds to -13.</li>
  <li>Round half towards zero: 13.5 rounds to 13, -13.5 rounds to -13.</li>
  <li>Round half away from zero: 13.5 rounds to 14, -13.5 rounds to -14. <em>I believe, this is the rule I was taught at school</em>.</li>
  <li>Round half to even: 13.5 rounds to 14, -13.5 rounds to -14, but 14.5 <em>also rounds</em> to 14, and -14.5 rounds to -14.</li>
  <li>Round half to odd: Opposite of the previous rule. 13.5 rounds to 13, -13.5 rounds to -13, 14.5 rounds to 15, -14.5 rounds to -15.</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are some <em>not so normal</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stochastic rounding: the choice of the result is… <em>random</em>!.</li>
  <li>Alternating tie-breaking: this just alternate round up and round down for.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rounding-in-programming-languages">Rounding in programming languages</h2>

<p>Just out of curiousity I checked how rounding works in a few popular programming languages. It seems like most of them use <em>Round half away from zero</em> rule, the most logical for me, since I was taught it as school.</p>

<p>So, this is what you’ll get in C, PHP 7, Python 2, Ruby 2:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="c1">// C's printf</span>
<span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"%g -&gt; %g, %g -&gt; %g, %g -&gt; %g, %g -&gt; %g</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>

<span class="c1">// output: 13.5 -&gt; 14, 14.5 -&gt; 15, -14.5 -&gt; -15, -13.5 -&gt; -14</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But, as was already mentioned, Python3 uses <em>Round half to even</em>, and it will be:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'%.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d'</span> \
<span class="p">...</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">13.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">13.5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mf">14.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">14.5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">14.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">14.5</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">13.5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">13.5</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="o">//</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">13.5</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">14.5</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">14.5</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">13.5</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">14</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What’s more surprising for me is that Java 8 also uses another rule - I guess it is <em>Round half towards zero</em>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printf</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"%.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d, %.1f -&gt; %d\n"</span><span class="o">,</span>

<span class="c1">// output: 13.5 -&gt; 14, 14.5 -&gt; 15, -14.5 -&gt; -14, -13.5 -&gt; -13</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Go 1.8 doesn’t have built-in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/4594">round function</a> at all, you have to choose from <a href="https://golang.
org/pkg/math/#Ceil">math.Ceil</a> or <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/#Floor">math.Floor</a> yourself.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, beware of different rules in different programming languages!</p>
