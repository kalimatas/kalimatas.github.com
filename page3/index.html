		<div>
			<p>I have recently come across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">Broken windows theory</a> article. It is a criminological theory which addresses the problems of urban disorder, vandalism and anti-social behavior. The theory states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… maintaining and monitoring urban environments to prevent small crimes such as vandalism, public drinking, and toll-jumping helps to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious crimes from happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in an article titled <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/">Broken Windows</a>, where they had an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it’s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.</p>

			<p>I’ve just finished working on my <a href="https://github.com/kalimatas/php-liquid">fork</a> of the Liquid template engine.</p>

<p><a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> is a templating library which was originally developed for usage with Ruby on Rails in <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>. It uses a combination of <em>tags</em>, <em>objects</em>, and <em>filters</em> to load dynamic content. They are used inside Liquid <em>template files</em>, which are a group of files that make up a theme.</p>

			<p><a href="http://golang.org/">Golang</a> has built-in instruments for writing concurrent programs. Placing a <a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec#Go_statements">go</a> statement before a function call starts the execution of that function as an independent concurrent thread in the same address space as the calling code. Such thread is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">goroutine</code> in Golang. Here I should mention that concurrently doesn’t always mean in parallel. Goroutines are means of creating concurrent architecture of a program which could possibly execute in parallel in case the hardware allows it. There is a great talk on that topic <a href="http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism">Concurrency is not parallelism</a>.</p>

		<div>
			<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It is inspiring and motivating. And the butler is a killer.</p>

<p>Last week I received an email with an invitation to a hackathon which was going to happen on weekend. I didn’t know much about these events so far — in my head there were only scrappy pieces of information gathered from different blogs and news sites pell-mell with photos of crowds of programmers sitting in comparatively small rooms and coding, and coding, and coding… Well, of course I’d like to be there.</p>

<p>Though there was a small problem: only 3 days left to the event and I had neither idea nor team. The chances of wining under such circumstances are slightly less than nothing. When I say “no idea” I don’t mean I did not have ideas at lot, on the contrary I had a whole bunch of ideas which (to be honest) I would never implement by myself.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI)</strong> is a universal interface between web servers and web applications for Python. <em>Universal</em> means there is no more need to design your application for a specific API interface of a web server like CGI, FastCGI, mod_python, etc. - implementing WSGI support in your application gives you opportunity to use it with any web server which in it’s turn has WSGI support.</p>

		<div>
			<p>Since I touched the keyboard for the first time when I was thirteen I never stop self-cultivating myself in the area. I even became a programmer and doomed myself on reading endless docs, tutorials and books. In one these books, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, there was a chapter about tools used by programmers where the opinion was told that <em>it is better to know one editor very well, and use it for all editing tasks</em>.</p>

<p>I agreed and decided to follow this advice. The only difficulty was to pick up the right editor, but since I wanted to be super/mega cool programmer the variants were obvious: <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. I chose VIM, to be honest, for one reason: because of horrible (in my opinion) Emacs key bindings.</p>

			<p>After playing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">canvas</a> for some time I gave a birth to this small piece of… code. If you don’t have any idea what it is I’ll give you a hint. It’s a gradually appearing target created with the help of HTML5 canvas element. 5 elements actually.</p>

<p>The idea is simple: create several canvas elements with different radius values and absolutely position them at the same point. Step by step drawing is archived by repeatedly calling a <em>drawCircle</em> function with different values of radius property until it reaches <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math.PI * 2</code>.</p>
