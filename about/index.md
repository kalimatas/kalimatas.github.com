Hello there! My name is Alexander Guz. I'm a backend software developer currently based
in Berlin, Germany and working at [FlixBus](https://www.flixbus.com/).

In this blog, I write mostly about topics revolving around software development.  
From time to time, you can stumble upon completely unrelated things, but in the end, it's my blog, right?
