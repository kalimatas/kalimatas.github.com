Hello there! My name is Alexander Guz. I'm a software developer currently living
in Berlin, Germany. My passion lies in programming in general. Also, I really
enjoy learning new stuff aside my [primary work](https://www.flixbus.com/).

I started this blog as a place where I can write down some of my thoughts on
various topics, to share different problems I am facing during development.
Moreover, this blog is a good way to advance my English.
