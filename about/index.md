Hello, my name is Alexander Guz and I'm a software developer currently living in Berlin, Germany. I'm passionate about programming in general and I really enjoy to learn new stuff aside my primary work.

I started this blog as a place where I can write down some of my thoughts on various tech (and sometimes non-tech) topics, and also to share different problems I am facing during development. Moreover, this blog is a good way to advance my English.
