Sometimes I have an idea. Aha, that happens. Even if it's not a very good idea I'm writing it down for future. There are a lot of variants to do this - from real paper and pencil to super-huge-cool-web-applications. I decided to reinvent the wheel and make my own.

Just a simple notebook for ideas. Runs of Google App Engine. You may use it :)) 

Wishes accepted.
