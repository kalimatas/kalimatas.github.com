I bet everybody knows this feeling when you get an interesting idea in your head, and 
you think – that is it! I need to do it! You start to dig into, but the first Google 
request shows that somebody has already implemented it. Bummer. I had one of those ideas
the other day.

Since around a year or a bit more, I am into running. For tracking my running time and 
routes I am using an application, of course. It is nice to look at some statistics. After
one of the runs, I looked at the route, and it reminded me of some figure or a drawing.
And then a thought came to me – what if we draw something  on a map while running using a 
GPS tracker?! Just imagine: a whole community running and sharing their routes!

My first deliberate attempt to draw during running was a letter “M“. It is supposed to be 
the first letter in either my wife's name, or in the word “Metallica“. I'm not sure yet.

As it turned out, I am not the only one to come up with this idea. Drawing on a map with 
a GPS tracker is called [GPS Art]. It originated in 90s, and, of course, became more 
popular with a spread of mobile GPS devices. Check out hashtag [#gpsart](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpsart&src=typed_query)
on Twitter for inspiration.

The community also has its heroes. For example, the largest drawings on Earth belong to
Japanese artist Yasushi Takahashi. Here is a word “peace“... [60,794 km long](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&mid=1nDdvPvZtyeh0a6uOxGTu7rEzRqI&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C26.488384499999995&z=2).

And here is “Marry Me“ [over the whole Japan](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=ja&mid=1m8Sevf2iWZT83ax5x2q6n8P8tBY&ll=38.29853440547071%2C137.199813859375&z=6).

But anyway, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So I guess I just go 
put my running shoes on and take a bunch of those single steps for now.
