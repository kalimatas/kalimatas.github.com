2019 is the first year I decided to track books I have read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106745400-alexander). Here is the list. Though, it might be not complete, because I got this idea only in December and struggled to recall all the books.

Quite clear that fiction prevails. Definitely will spend more time reading more useful books this year.
