I have been using Evernote for quite some years now as my go-to note taking application.
Indeed, it is not a bad choice: clients for all platforms you can imagine, synchronization
between devices, good enough editor with formatting, typical hierarchical notes 
organization into notebooks and sub-notebooks, tags, sharing options, etc. I even had a
paid version in order to have synchronization on more than two devices. And still, 
I have never felt that I have been using all its potential.

Eventually, the notes were lying "dead" there. Like a pile of useless crap. todo: elaborate on that

I stumbled upon Roam Research – hype app now. It had invitation system. ... And from there –
by watching tutorial, reading articles – I grasped the idea of a second brain, a personal
knowledge base. This is where it all clicked – my Evernote are junk, because they are not
connected to each other. Yes, I have a notebook "Programming", but notes inside this 
notebook are just separate peaces with no relation to each other whatsoever. These 
relations exist only in my head. And my head has only so much free space to hold all 
this stuff.

The essential part that is missing in Evernote in comparison to, let's say Roam Research,
is linking of the notes. One can argue, that Evernote has notes links. But functionality-wise
they are a joke. Imagine you're writing a note about new sorting algorithm and now you 
want to link some passage to big-O notation. You have to: 1) find big-O note (potentially
in another notebook), then 2) right click and find an option to copy the link, and then 
3) go back to the place where you want to place the link and, finally, paste it. I almost
died from boredom by just explaining this procedure. By the time you finished it, you had
already lost any thought train you could had.

Just to have a link inside a note to another note is not enough, though.
todo: idea of back links and notes discovery. Associations. Blah-blah.

Started to look into options, endless articles. 
 - Roam Research is too expensive TBH. Not yet.
 - Obsidian no block linking and... markdown, really?!
 - RemNote. Now we are talking. It is good, it is functional. It is ugly. Oh yeah. 

But I like the spirit. Started to use it. Canceled Evernote subscription. But it is a long
way for them to become great. Promote. Switch to Roam Research. I don't like how the editor
jump when you click on a bullet point... Come on guys!
