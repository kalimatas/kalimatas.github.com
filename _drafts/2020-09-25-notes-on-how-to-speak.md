Speaking is an essential part of human interactions. Most of take this ability to 
speak for granted. Indeed, we can utilize language for day-to-day purposes. But public
speaking scares and make uncomfortable most of us. It is a skill you need to develop.

I recently stumbled upon a lecture “How to Speak“ by Patrick Winston. Here are my notes 
and thoughts on the lecture.
