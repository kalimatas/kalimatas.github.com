## <a name="first"></a> First paragraph header

The first paragraph is used to 'animate' your essay or article, to give it life and meaning and context. In my own writing, my animation is often a short story about myself showing how the topic is important to me. Animating paragraphs may express feelings - joy, happiness, sadness, or whatever. They may consist of short stories or examples of what you are trying to describe

Second paragraph will tell people what your essay says. Here is also a reference to note [[1]](#1).

Here are four article types according to https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=38526.

Argument: convinces someone of something
Explanation: tells why something happened instead of something else
Definition: states what a word or concept means
Description: identifies properties or qualities of things
