		VIM, IDE.
	</section>
	
	<section id="article-content">
		<p>Since I touched the keyboard for the first time when I was thirteen I never stop self-cultivating myself in the area. I even became a programmer and doomed myself on reading endless docs, tutorials and books. In one these books, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, there was a chapter about tools used by programmers where the opinion was told that <em>it is better to know one editor very well, and use it for all editing tasks</em>.</p>

<p>I agreed and decided to follow this advice. The only difficulty was to pick up the right editor, but since I wanted to be super/mega cool programmer the variants were obvious: <a href="http://www.vim.org">VIM</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. I chose VIM, to be honest, for one reason: because of horrible (in my opinion) Emacs key bindings.</p>

<p>I can almost hear you guys laughing and saying something like “Good luck, man!”. And taking into consideration <a href="http://mrozekma.com/editor-learning-curve.png">learning curves</a> of these editors I can understand you. But I did my best and after a couple of months struggling through official/non-official documentation, dozens of dot-files I could finally exit that damn editor without breaking anything. My productivity increased noticeably. I liked that way I could edit text without even touching a mouse flitting across the text with every key stroke.</p>

<p>I’ve been using Vim for about 4 years for now. And I still think I know only about 30% of it’s possibilities, I still find new variants of configurations. Actually the recipe for successful working with Vim is quite simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>read docs</li>
  <li>apply rasp</li>
  <li>do your work</li>
  <li>repeat</li>
</ul>

<p>As a programmer I used Vim for source code editing, but since Vim is not an IDE I had to apply some effort to make it more convenient for that purpose. And again: tons of documentation, articles about turning Vim into <em>The-Best-IDE-Ever-Created</em>, dozens of plugins and so on. But no matter how hard I tried the truth was disappointing - I spent too much time learning/configuring my tool instead of doing some work with it. I thought too much not about what I’m doing but about <em>HOW</em> I’m doing it.</p>

<p>So now the time has come to abandon Vim as my IDE and choose some more appropriate tool. R.I.P. Vim as IDE.</p>
