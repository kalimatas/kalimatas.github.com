		<p>I’d like to do something useful. No kidding. Something I or someone else could use. When I come up with some idea I start to think about details and about what technologies I should use for its implementation.

<p>For example, I wanted to create a small web app which will help me to send POST request (need for my current job project). I’ve chosen Python and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> as technologies, mostly because I’m learning Python now. Ok, let’s read what Flask is. Hm, it’s based on Werkzeug and Jinja2. Well, let us a look at them. WSGI? What’s that?</p>

<p>After some time I found myself sitting in front of my computer with VIM opened and a few lines of code there:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">wsgiref.simple_server</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">make_server</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">app</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">start_response</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'200 Ok'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[(</span><span class="s">'Content-type'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'text/html'</span><span class="p">)])</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">'Hello from wsgi!'</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">httpd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">make_server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">''</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8005</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">app</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">httpd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">serve_forever</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s too far away from my initial task as you understand. So what happened?</p>

<p>When I started to read about Flask it turned out that I don’t want to use it until I get a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms. The same about Werkzeug and Jinja.  Don’t know whether I should cry or laugh. On the one hand this will for deep knowledge serves me well - after spending some hours/days/weeks/months of reading and trying I feel like a pro in the subject. But on the other hand I spent my time learning and not doing something really useful.</p>

<p>Remember the beginning of the post?</p>
